# pandas-challenge

- For this challenge we aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

  ## Instructions
  
    1. Create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
    1. Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
    1. Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
    1. Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
    1. Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level at each school.
    1. Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level at each school.
    1. Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
    1. Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
    1. Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.
